  h2 About

  p.
    The <a href="https://donatinator.org/">Donatinator</a> is a small, simple, and secure way to accept online
    donations (single or recurring) for your charity or non-profit. It does not try to be a fully-fledged Content
    Management System, therefore there may be some things you wish to do but can't do here. Therefore you may wish to
    run this site under a sub-domain of your organisation, such as <code>secure.example.org</code> or
    <code>donate.example.org</code>.

  p.
    Please refer to the <a href="https://donatinator.org/features">Features</a> page for more information.

  p.
    Many thanks.
